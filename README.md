# Mini Expense Tracker API

This project is a simple backend application built with **Node.js** and **Express.js** to track daily expenses.  
It supports basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for managing expenses.

## Features
- Add a new expense
- View all expenses by date range
- Update or delete expenses by ID
- Unit testing with Mocha and Chai
- Black-box testing (Boundary Value Analysis and Equivalence Class Partitioning)
- GitHub Actions (CI/CD) setup for automated testing
- Deployed live using Render
- Postman collection created for API testing

## ðŸ’» Technologies Used
- Node.js
- Express.js
- Mocha (Unit Testing)
- Chai (Assertions)
- Postman (API Testing)
- Render (Deployment)
- GitHub Actions (CI/CD Automation)

## ðŸ§ª Testing Details

âœ… White-box testing (Mocha unit tests)  
âœ… Black-box testing:
- Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)
- Equivalence Class Partitioning (ECP)  
âœ… Postman used for API verification  
âœ… Automated test execution using GitHub Actions  

## ðŸ”„ CI/CD Pipeline

- **CI**: GitHub Actions runs automatically on every push to `main`
- Steps in `.github/workflows/nodejs.yml`:
  - `npm install --no-optional`
  - `npm test`

## ðŸ“¦ Postman Testing (Black-box)

Postman was used for API testing:
- **BVA example**: amount = 0 (validated)
- **ECP example**: missing category or invalid amount = -10
- All endpoints were tested manually via Postman to ensure correct error handling and response format
